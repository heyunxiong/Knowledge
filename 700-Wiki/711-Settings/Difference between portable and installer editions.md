Difference between portable and installer editions
https://www.softperfect.com/contact/knowledgebase.php?article=29
  
Some of our software products are offered in two editions: portable and installed.

-   Portable application is just an executable file. It can be placed in a folder on your computer, a USB flash drive or any other removable media and launched from there. Portable software creates configuration files in its folder and usually doesnâ€™t change anything in the system it runs on. If you copy the configuration files together with the executable file to another media, all your settings will be carried across too.
    
-   Installer is an application packaged into an installation program. The installer places the application into a specific folder (usually in Program Files), creates shortcuts and adds an uninstaller. The installer may also register extra components in the system to enable additional functionality in the application.
    

Unless you have specific reasons to use the portable edition, it is best to use the installer.
