Hi All,

There is a simple solution that worked for me. Credit goes to someone else's reply that I found on the net, but have lost the link to it. Basically, if you have Microsoft Onenote 2016, go to >File >Open, then scroll down to "Recent" documents. You will see a list of all recently opened Onenote documents. Right click on those documents and remove from list. Close Onenote 2016. Open "Windows Version Onenote". Click on "More Notebooks", then all those previously deleted Onenote docs will no longer appear in the listing.

Good Luck!
