Complete List of Environment Variables in Windows 10
Environment variables are a set of dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. The variables can be used both in scripts and on the command line. Environment variables makes it easy when certain standard directories and parameters need to be referenced but where the actual locations or names can vary from computer to computer.
The variable (ex: "%UserProfile%") is used as a type of shortcut of the value (ex: "C:\Users\<username>").
There are two types of environment variables: user environment variables (set only for current user) and system environment variables (set for all users).
