# Maven



## 生命周期

有三个内置生命周期

- default
- clean
- site

对于default生命周期由以下几个阶段构成

- `validate` - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
- `compile` - compile the source code of the project
- `test` - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
- `package` - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
- `verify` - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
- `install` - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
- `deploy` - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

每一个阶段由插件目标组成
